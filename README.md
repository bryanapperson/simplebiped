# simplebiped

About four years back I wrote up a program for and designed a bipedal robot
in blender (I coined it the SimpleBiped) based on the Arduino Micro board.
It is robot which uses ultrasonic sensors for object detection,
and some basic logic for navigation as well as some primitives for servo
control. The robot had 5 servos as defined in the code in this repository
